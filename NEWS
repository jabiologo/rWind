o wind.mean have improve his performance (it is much faster now).

o flow.dispersion have improve his performance, using matrix rather than raster objects to perform the maths (it is much faster now). Now you can also obtain as output either, a graph, a transitionLayer or a Sparse Matrix (see documentation).

o Two new datasets has been added to improve the example code:
    - "wind_data" is a downloaded data with wind.dl
    - "wind_series" is a downloaded series of wind data with wind.dl
