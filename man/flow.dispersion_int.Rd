\title{Compute flow-based cost or conductance}
\usage{
flow.dispersion_int(stack, fun = cost.FMGS, output = "transitionLayer", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{stack}{RasterStack object with layers obtained from wind2raster
function ("rWind" package) with direction and speed flow values.}

\item{fun}{A function to compute the cost to move between cells. The default
is \code{cost.FMGS} from Felicísimo et al. (2008), see details.}

\item{output}{This argument allows to select different kinds of output. "raw"
mode creates a matrix (class "dgCMatrix") with transition costs between all
cells in the raster. "transitionLayer" creates a TransitionLayer object with
conductance values to be used with "gdistance" package.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
In "transitionLayer" output, the function returns conductance values
(1/cost)to move between all cells in a raster having into account flow speed
and direction obtained from wind.fit function("rWind" package). As wind or
sea currents implies directionality, flow.dispersion produces an anisotropic
conductance matrix (asymmetric). Conductance values are used later to built a
TransitionLayer object from "gdistance" package.

In "raw" output, flow.dispersion creates a sparse Matrix with cost values.
}
\description{
flow.dispersion_int computes movement conductance through a flow either, sea
or wind currents. It implements the formula described in Felícisimo et al.
2008:
}
\details{
Cost=(1/Speed)*(HorizontalFactor)

being HorizontalFactor a "function that incrementally penalized angular
deviations from the wind direction" (Felicísimo et al. 2008). Only \emph{passive}
movements are currently allowed.
}
\note{
Note that for large data sets, it could take a while. For large study
areas is strongly advised perform the analysis in a remote computer or a
cluster.
